Practice Questions
  1.  What is []?
    - square bracket, identify that the variable referencing to it is a list.

  2.  How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)
    - spam[2] = 'hello'
For the following three questions, assume spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].

  3.  What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] evaluate to?
    - d

  4.  What does spam[-1] evaluate to?
    - d

  5.  What does spam[:2] evaluate to?
    - a,b

For the following three questions, assume bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].

  6.  What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
        - 1

  7.  What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
        - bacon list with the 99 at the very end 
  8.  What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
        - same bacon list without 'cat'

  9.  What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?
    - conc= + , repl = *

10.  What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?
    - insert adds element to spesified index, appends adds element to the end of the list 

11.  What are two ways to remove values from a list?
    - del list[i], lsir.remove('cat')

12.  Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.
    - in ordered sequence, indexed,sliced,len,in, not in can be used, for can be used for iteratiopn 

13.  What is the difference between lists and tuples?
tuples are immutable

14.  How do you write the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?
tuple = (42,)

15.  How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?
    - To get the tuple form of a list: Use the tuple() constructor. Example: my_tuple = tuple(my_list)
    -  To get the list form of a tuple: Use the list() constructor. Example: my_list = list(my_tuple)

16.  Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?
- references

17.  What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
copy.copy copies the reference of the original list, so the change in original list
affects copy, however deepcopy creates a  copy so that it copies the values to references
