# Automate the Boring Stuff Practice

Hands-on practice repo for *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*. Every script is a bite size exercise to reinforce a chapter concept,no external dependencies, just standard library Python 3. Use these as references, launch points for your own tweaks, or quick reminders when revisiting a topic.

## Repository structure

- `chapter-4` … basic control flow and recursion (e.g., `collatz.py`).
- `chapter-5` … dictionaries, exceptions, logging, and assertions.
- `chapter-6` … lists, references, and simple daily motivator snippets.
- `chapter-7` … dictionaries, nesting, and simple data utilities.
- `chapter-8` … string manipulation helpers (e.g., Pig Latin, bullet point adder).
- `chapter-9` … regex-based utilities like phone/strong password checkers.
- `chapter-10` … file I/O exercises; includes the quiz generator in `randomquizgen.py`.
- `chapter-11` … file organization and zipping examples using `pathlib`/`shutil`.
- `chapter-12` … placeholder for scripting examples.
- `additional projects` … extra experiments such as `bomb_game.py`, `coinflip_experiment.py`, and a Matrix rain toy.
- `additional files` … text files used by some scripts or for experimentation.

## Notes on specific scripts

- `chapter-10/randomquizgen.py`: generates 35 quiz/answer files; run it inside `chapter-10/quizes/` to keep output organized.
- `chapter-11/file_organization.py`: demonstrates copying and moving files; it creates `spam/` and `spam2/` folders in your working directory.
- `additional projects/coinflip_experiment.py`: skeleton for a 10,000-trial coin-flip streak simulation.
